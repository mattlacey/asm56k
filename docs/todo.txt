
BETA TODO:

- There's a problem with forward declared variables and IF directive. Detect forward refference and error
- write docs
- write tests (OP_MOVEP)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V 1.5 TODO:
- smarter DS handling ?
- pipeline restrictions!
- check for overlaping chunks
- repeat instructions
- verify falcon dsp memory scheme. for example, if we define a chunk in internal memory warn if we're going past that, etc.
- move inlcuding of files into parser rather then lexer.
	* include code is dodgy
	* refactor file inclusion code, change variables names to be more sane, extract file inclusion code from Include_file function

- write out dependencies (something like gcc does)
- deduplication in StringBuffer (I doubt it will ever be a memory problem)
- exit after first error (switch)
- ??? make "syntax error" display tokens it failed to parse

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE:
- export p56 as devpac/vasm source files (?)
- fixed #> integer mode
- added new test
- Fixed a division by 0 problem
- L: memory addresses are wrong! 
- IFGT, LT, GE, etc.
- don't allow code generation in L: memory
- export P56
- make sure L: memory works
- make local labels work in every context
- short IO adressing (<<) is broken ... review adressing mode code
- segmentation crash when else is encoutered without matching if
- implement DS statement
- implement DSM statement
- implement casting strings to ints
- text constants crashes the assembler
- implement "*" symbol.
- cleanup lex files too.
- implement error and msg directive
- unfold include/macro path in errors
- c-style comments are broken
- refactor grammar.y, remove embeded C code to a file(s) [almost done]
- cleanup TokenStream and MacroProxy
- add checks for macro stack overflows
- use optc to parse input args
- cleanup main.c, split it itto files [almost done]
- make sure fractional arithmetics works
- test macros some more
